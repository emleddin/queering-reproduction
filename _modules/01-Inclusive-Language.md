summary:
- "Ask what language people use to describe themselves, their body, and their
family structure. Then, use those terms!"
- "Consider a patient's entire office visit. What microaggressions might they be facing from the moment they walk in the door, and how can you mitigate them?"

Transgender and non-binary people often spend a lot of time explaining their
identity and fielding intrusive questions about their bodies.

The key thing is that it is better to ask than to assume, but how you ask
makes a difference.

## Names and Pronouns

Legal name changes take both time and money.
Not every trans person changes their name, and those that do may go through a
period where they try different names to see what works best for them.
