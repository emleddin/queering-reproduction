summary:
- "Ask what language people use to describe themselves, their body, and their
family structure. Then, use those terms!"
- "Consider a patient's entire office visit. What microaggressions might they
be facing from the moment they walk in the door, and how can you mitigate them?"
- "Work out a system in your workplace that communicates name changes in a
meaningful way, so that a correction at check-in is acknowledged throughout an
entire visit."

Transgender and non-binary people often spend a lot of time explaining their
identity and fielding intrusive questions about their bodies.

The key thing is that it is better to ask than to assume, but how you ask
makes a difference.

## Names, Pronouns, and Honorifics

Legal name changes require both time and money.
Not every trans person changes their name, and those that do may go through a
period where they try different names to see what works best for them.
While a person is transitioning or learning more about their gender identity,
they may request to be called a name that is not their legal name.
It is important to use that name, just as it would be important for
rapport-building to use a nickname that someone asks to go by (i.e., someone
named Robert who asks to be called Bob).

Like names, a person may wish to be addressed by different pronouns or honorifics.
Pronouns and honorifics do not always equate gender identity, so a person
assigned female at birth using he/him pronouns with the "Mr." honorific may not
mean that that person regards himself entirely as a man (or even as a man
at all).

| Subject    | they     | ze      | he      | she     | **They** like science.  |
| Object     | them     | hir     | him     | her     | I told **hir** a story. |
| Possessive | theirs   | hirs    | his     | hers    | That coat is **his**.   |
| Reflexive  | themself | hirself | himself | herself | Sam did it **herself**. |

Pronouns sets like ze/hir are known as neopronouns, and tend to be used as a
gender-neutral pronouns.
Some common honorifics include Mr., Miss, Ms., Mrs., and Mx.
Mx. tends to be viewed as a gender-neutral honorific.
Again, just because someone uses neopronouns or Mx. does not mean that they
have a specific gender identity, or that those pronouns or honorifics match any
particular gender identity.

Using the correct names, pronouns, and honorifics are the most basic form of
respect that can be afforded to transgender and non-binary people.

## Getting It Wrong

It is not realistic to expect someone to learn of a new name, pronoun, or
honorific and immediately use it perfectly moving forward.
Thus, it is necessary to know how to react when you realize your mistake or
when you are corrected by someone else.
Apologies that are overly profuse can make the other person uncomfortable.
Similarly, taking the moment to say something like "it's just so hard for me"
places and emotional burden on the person who was misgendered or misnamed to
comfort you.
Offer a quick "sorry" and keep the conversation moving.

> Eric, sorry, Erica...

> **Person 1**: When I was talking to him earlier...
>
> **Person 2**: Her
>
> **Person 1**: Her, right sorry, when I was talking to her earlier...

## Updating Workplace Forms and Processes

Forms used in healthcare settings often ask for demographic information in a
way that can be alienating to transgender and non-binary patients.
Forms that only ask for legal name and sex serve as a signal to patients that
their identity is not something that will be respected in that space.<sup>3,4</sup>
Selecting the "wrong" box can also lead to awkward situations, such as someone
believing that a transgender man who selected "Female" for their sex made a
mistake, despite them being listed as female on their insurance.
These forms also tend to include gendered options for honorifics, and may be
written in such a way that assume a person is both heterosexual and monogamous.

Often, computer systems need to be updated in order to reflect preferred names
for patients.<sup>5</sup>
