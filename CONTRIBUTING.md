# Contributing to Queering Reproduction

If you have expertise to add on a topic area and are willing to speak to it,
please consider contributing to this project.
All pages are written in
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), so
no true coding experience is necessary (but a GitHub account is)!

## Using GitHub and/or Jekyll
Information on using GitHub to make a fork (your personal copy of the project)
and edit it can be found in the
[GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

If you wanted to build and test this site locally, first download your forked
copy (or these original source files) to your computer.
You can do the latter with a Terminal command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/emleddin/queering-reproduction
```

Then, you need to install
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

The first time you work on a Jekyll project, you'll need to use the command
`bundle install` to install the appropriate gems.
If you forget, bundle will prompt you to do so.

Then, to build the local test, run:
```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The test site will auto-update as you save changes on your local files.
Once you're satisfied with the changes, commit them and submit a pull request.

## Report an Issue

Is there something on the site that doesn't look quite right?
Have a source that challenges the site's content? Feel free to submit it
as a GitHub issue.
Literature with a clear negative bias against transgender and non-binary people
and their healthcare decisions will not be considered reputable.
