# Welcome!

Welcome to Queering Reproduction, a site aimed at informing healthcare providers
and their patients with information on trans- and nonbinary-inclusive
reproductive healthcare.
The goal is to make this information as transparent and accessible as possible,
while acknowledging that much of the current literature is obscured by paywalls.
To help fulfill that goal, this site is open-source on GitHub, and anyone
is able to contribute.

Queering Reproduction was born out of the 2020 AMSA Reproductive Health Scholars
Program.

This site is currently under development.
